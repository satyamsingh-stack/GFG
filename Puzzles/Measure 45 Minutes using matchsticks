How do we measure forty-five minutes using two identical wires, each of which takes an hour to burn? We have matchsticks with us. 
The wires burn non-uniformly. So, for example, the two halves of wire might burn in 10 minutes and 50 minutes respectively??

Answer:
If we light a stick, it takes 60 minutes to burn completely. What if we light the stick from both sides? It will take exactly half the original time, i.e. 30 minutes 
to burn completely.

  1) 0 minutes – Light stick 1 on both sides and stick 2 on one side.
  2) 30 minutes – Stick 1 will be burnt out. Light the other end of stick 2.
  3) 45 minutes – Stick 2 will be burnt out. Thus 45 minutes is completely measured.
